# MST_Kruskal.cpp

This file implements Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted graph.

## Usage

*   **Description:** This file implements Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted graph.
*   **Functions:**
    *   `MST(int n, const vector<E>& edges)`
        *   **Description:** Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted graph using Kruskal's algorithm.
        *   **Args:**
            *   `n (int)`: The number of vertices in the graph.
            *   `edges (const vector<E>&)`: A vector of edges, where each edge is a tuple containing the two vertices and the weight.
        *   **Returns:**
            *   `vector<E>`: A vector of edges representing the MST.
