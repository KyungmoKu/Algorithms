This file contains a global function.

## Lagrange

```cpp
void Lagrange(){ ... }
```

*   **Description:** Implements the Lagrange Relaxation technique for optimization problems.
*   **Note:** The function `f(lambda)` needs to be defined within the lambda to solve the specific problem. The goal is to find the optimal value by adjusting the Lagrange multiplier.
